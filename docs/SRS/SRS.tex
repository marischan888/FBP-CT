\section{Introduction} \label{introduction}
%% Problem domain
Image reconstruction is the process of turning raw data collected by the
detectors into image data which can be viewed on a screen. \add{The most common
  CT image reconstruction method is back-projection. However, there is a large
  amount of noise in this method which result a blur reconstructed image
  \cite{Beatty2012}.} \st{Both raw data and image data can be manipulated in
  different ways to create images with differing properties. The most
  rudimentary process of turning raw data into image data is called
  back-projection. This is the process of mathematically mapping the attenuation
  pathway at every angle measured through a scan to locate where in a patient
  attenuation is occurring. However, even if the number of back-projection is
  increased (say to 1000 directions), there is still a large amount of noise
  blurring the recreate image. As it turns out, no matter how many directions we
  try to backproject in, it is not able to perfectly recreate our image using
  the back-projection. For this process to be at all useful, it is necessary to
  derive a way to filter out some of the noise the back-projection formula seems
  to create in our picture and get a smoother representation of our object.}
\add{\progname aims to filter out the noise and provide a clearer reconstructed CT image for
  researchers by applying filter techniques during the back-projection. This
  tool also provide a simulation to sinogram for researchers who want to
  simulate the CT detector behavior(collect the intensity and generate the
  sinogram data) given the image of organ when they can not get the data from patients.}

%% Roadmap for what subsection to expect in the Introduction
The following subsections will outline the primary aspects of SRS,
ensuring clarity in understanding the \progname purpose, scope, and organization of the
system requirements.

\subsection{Purpose of Document}
This document serves to guide software developers and researchers in
understanding the technical challenges and requirements involved in the project.
It aims to facilitate effective communication between team members and domain
experts, ensuring a correct and efficient implementation of Filter
Back-projection (FBP) method for CT image reconstruction.

Additionally, this document serves as a reference for users of the software to
understand its capabilities, limitations, and assumptions. It also acts as a
valuable resource for future maintenance, and verification of the implemented
methods, ensuring long-term usability and reliability of the software.

\subsection{Scope of Requirements}
This project focuses on implementing FBP methods for CT image reconstruction,
with simplifications applied to manage the complexity of real-world challenges.
The scope is constrained to reconstructing 2D images from raw projection data
obtained through ideal scanning conditions. It excludes considerations such as
non-ideal scanner geometries, variations in detector sensitivity, or artifacts
caused by motion during scanning.

The implementation will primarily address noise reduction and basic filtering,
without delving into advanced techniques like iterative reconstruction or
machine learning-based enhancements. The software assumes uniform spacing
between projection angles and consistent image resolution.

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader} \label{sec_IntendedReader}
The intended readers of this document are individuals involved in the development,
review, and maintenance of the FBP tool for CT image reconstruction. These
readers are expected to have a basic understanding of computed tomography
principles and image processing techniques such as Fourier transforms, Random
transforms, linear algebra and Python.

\subsection{Organization of Document}
The introduction section (Section~\ref{introduction}) provides an overview of
the project, including the purpose, scope, and intended audience for this
document. The General System Description (Section~\ref{general description}) outlines
the context and high-level requirements of the system. Detailed problem
definitions, theoretical foundations, and specific system functionalities are
described in the Specific System Description (Section~\ref{specific description}). The
Requirements section (Section~\ref{requirement}) specifies both functional
and non-functional requirements. The document concludes with an overview of
potential changes and their implications for future development.

\section{General System Description} \label{general description}

This section provides general information about the system.  It identifies the
interfaces between the system and its environment, describes the user
characteristics and lists the system constraints.

\subsection{System Context}
\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{SysConfig.png}
\caption{System Context}
\label{Fig_SystemContext}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\begin{itemize}
\item User Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Provide X-ray projection data in a standardized format.
\item Select appropriate filtering methods.
\item Interpret and analyze the reconstructed images.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
\item Software Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Validate input data to ensure compatibility with the processing pipeline.
\item Apply transformations and filtering to extract attenuation values.
\item Generate reconstructed images based on back-projection techniques.
\item Ensure computational efficiency by leveraging optimized libraries.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Characteristics} \label{SecUserCharacteristics} The primary
users of this tool for CT image reconstruction are individuals with a background
in computed tomography, image processing, and numerical methods. They are
expected to have at least an undergraduate-level understanding of calculus,
linear algebra, and Fourier transforms, as these concepts are fundamental to the
reconstruction process. Familiarity with Radon transforms, filtering techniques
(such as Ramp and Shepp-Logan filters) \st{, and Python programming} is also required
to effectively use and modify the system. Users may include medical imaging
researchers, software engineers developing CT reconstruction algorithms, and
graduate students studying image processing techniques.

\subsection{System Constraints}
This tool must operate within specific system constraints to ensure
compatibility, performance, and usability. \add{The \progname \space is limited
  by the trade-off between noise suppression and edge preservation imposed by
  the choice of frequency-domain filters (e.g., Ramp, Shepp-Logan, Hamming).
  Additionally, the system requires sufficient computational resources to
  perform Fourier transforms and back-projection efficiently, especially for
  high-resolution images.}
\st{The software must be implemented in Python, leveraging libraries
  such as NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-image for numerical computations and image
  processing. It must support grayscale 2D images with a fixed resolution to
  ensure uniform data
  processing.\\

Additionally, the system should be optimized to run efficiently on
standard computing hardware, avoiding dependencies on specialized GPU
acceleration. Furthermore, the input data format must conform to a standardized
structure, ensuring that projection data and filtering parameters align with the
expected mathematical models.

\subsubsection{Assumptions} \label{sec_assumpt}
This section simplifies the original problem and helps in developing the
theoretical model by filling in the missing information for the physical system.
The numbers given in the square brackets refer to the theoretical model [TM],
general definition [GD], data definition [DD], instance model [IM], or likely
change [LC], in which the respective assumption is used.

\begin{itemize}
\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A1}:] The Ramp and
  Shepp-Logan filters are assumed to be representative of high-pass and low-pass
  filtering techniques. [TM\ref{TM4}, TM\ref{TM5}, IM\ref{IM1}, IM\ref{IM2}]

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A2}:] The system assumes that
  the CT scanner uses a monochromatic (single-energy) X-ray source to avoid beam
  hardening artifacts. In reality, CT scanners use polychromatic X-rays, but for
  mathematical simplicity, this assumption is made. [DD\ref{DD1}]
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Detailed derivation of converting intensity from spatial domain to
  projection domain}

The X-ray intensity [DD\ref{DD1}] after passing through an object follows:

\begin{equation}
    I(t, \theta) = I_0 e^{-\int_{\textnormal{x-ray path}} f(x,y) ds}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( I(t, \theta) \) is the measured intensity at detector position \( t \) for angle \( \theta \),
    \item \( I_0 \) is the initial X-ray intensity,
    \item \( f(x,y) \) is the attenuation coefficient of the object, [DD\ref{DD2}]
    \item The integral sums the attenuation along the X-ray path \( ds \).
\end{itemize}

To linearize this equation, we take the natural logarithm on both sides:

\begin{equation}
    \ln I(t, \theta) = \ln I_0 - \int_{\textnormal{x-ray path}} f(x,y) ds
\end{equation}

Rearranging the equation:

\begin{equation}
    -\ln \left( \frac{I(t, \theta)}{I_0} \right) = \int_{\textnormal{x-ray path}} f(x,y) ds
\end{equation}

Thus, defining the projection data \( P(t, \theta) \):

\begin{equation}
    P(t,\theta) = -\ln(\frac{I(t,\theta)}{I_0})
\end{equation}

This equation represents the Radon Transform [TM\ref{TM2}], which maps the
intensity from spatial domain $I(t, \theta)$ into the projection domain $P(t, \theta)$.

\subsubsection*{Derivation of Filter Back Projection}
The Filtered Back Projection (FBP) reconstructs an image from X-ray
projections by first applying a log transformation to convert intensity
measurements into projection data. The Fourier Transform is then used to filter
the projections with a ramp or shepp-logan filter, which enhances high-frequency
details. The filtered projections are then transformed back using the Inverse
Fourier Transform. Finally, integration over all projection angles $\theta$ performs the back-projection, reconstructing the $A(x,y)$.

\subsubsection{Input Data Constraints} \label{sec_DataConstraints}

Table~\ref{TblInputVar} shows the data constraints on the input output
variables.  The column for physical constraints gives the physical limitations
on the range of values that can be taken by the variable.  The column for
software constraints restricts the range of inputs to reasonable values.  The
software constraints will be helpful in the design stage for picking suitable
algorithms.  The constraints are conservative, to give the user of the model the
flexibility to experiment with unusual situations.  The column of typical values
is intended to provide a feel for a common scenario.  The uncertainty column
provides an estimate of the confidence with which the physical quantities can be
measured.  This information would be part of the input if one were performing an
uncertainty quantification exercise.

The specification parameters in Table~\ref{TblInputVar} are listed in
Table~\ref{TblSpecParams}.

\subsubsection{Properties of a Correct Solution} \label{sec_CorrectSolution}

\noindent
A correct Filtered Back Projection reconstruction must adhere to physical
correctness and computational stability. \st{The reconstructed image should preserve
the total attenuation observed in the sinogram, ensuring consistency with the
projection data.} Additionally, the attenuation values must remain non-negative,
as negative attenuation is not physically meaningful. The reconstruction must
also respect constraints derived from the X-ray attenuation model, ensuring
values stay within a reasonable range.

A sample table is shown in Table~\ref{TblOutputVar}

\begin{table}[!h]
\caption{Output Variables} \label{TblOutputVar}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
\noindent \begin{longtable*}{l l}
  \toprule
  \textbf{Var} & \textbf{Physical Constraints} \\
  \midrule
  $A(x,y)$ & $0 \leq A(x,y) \leq A_{max}$\\
  \bottomrule
\end{longtable*}
\end{table}
$A_{max}$ depends on the highest attenuation material in the scan.
\section{Requirements} \label{requirement}
This section provides the functional requirements, the business tasks that the
software is expected to complete, and the nonfunctional requirements, the
qualities that the software is expected to exhibit.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R1}:] \add{The system should
    provide a CT detector simulation to generate sinograms given images for reconstruction.}\st{The system must accept a
  grayscale 2D input image, apply the Radon Transform to generate projection
  data, and ensure that intensity values are normalized between 0 and 1} (from
  IM\ref{IM1} and IM\ref{IM2}).

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R2}:] The system must allow users
  to select a filtering method, choosing between the \add{Hann, Hamming}Ramp and Shepp-Logan
  filters. (from IM\ref{IM1} and IM\ref{IM2})
\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R3}:] The system must perform the
  back-projection over all projection angles to reconstruct the attenuation
  coefficient after filtering (from IM\ref{IM1} and IM\ref{IM2}).

%\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R4}:] The reconstructed attenuation
%  values must be non-negative and consistent with input projections.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Nonfunctional Requirements}
\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Accuracy}:]
  \textbf{Accuracy} The reconstructed attenuation values must have an error margin
  within tolerance compared to the ground truth.

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Usability}:] \textbf{Usability} The
  system shall provide an \add{detailed user guide.}\st{interface that allows users to input projection data
  and visualize both sinograms and reconstructed images, with instructions
  detailed in the user guide}.

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Maintainability}:]
  \textbf{Maintainability} Any modification to the image reconstruction
  algorithm or filtering process should require less than 10\% of the original
  development time, ensuring ease of updates and enhancements.

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Portability}:]
  \textbf{Portability} The system shall be executable on Windows, macOS, and
  Linux without modification.

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Reusability}:]
  \textbf{Reusability} The system shall provide a well-documented API that allows
  developers to integrate and apply additional filtering methods beyond Ramp and
  Shepp-Logan filters.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Rationale}
The rationale behind the design of this CT Image Reconstruction System is based
on balancing accuracy, computational efficiency, and extensibility. The Filtered
Back Projection method was chosen due to its well-established
effectiveness in reconstructing images from projection data while maintaining
computational feasibility.\st{ The inclusion of both Ramp and Shepp-Logan filters
provides flexibility in handling noise and resolution trade-offs. The log
transformation of intensity data was incorporated to ensure the attenuation
model aligns with the Radon Transform formulation.}\\

\st{The system is designed with modularity in mind, allowing future integration of
additional filtering techniques through an API, enhancing reusability. The
implementation adheres to standard non-functional requirements, including
accuracy validation via MSE and PSNR, ensuring usability through a clear user
interface, and guaranteeing portability across multiple platforms. These
decisions collectively ensure a robust, adaptable, and scientifically grounded
reconstruction framework.}
\section{Likely Changes}

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_1}:] Future improvements may
  introduce additional filtering methods beyond Ramp and Shepp-Logan filters,
  requiring the API to support more flexible and adaptive reconstruction
  techniques (A\ref{A1}).

\end{itemize}

\section{Unlikely Changes}

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[UC\refstepcounter{ucnum}\theucnum\label{UC_1}:] The fundamental mathematical
  model for Radon Transform and Filtered Back Projection is unlikely to change,
  as it is a well-established method in CT image reconstruction and widely
  validated in medical imaging.
\end{itemize}

\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}

The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what
has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  Every time a
component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked
with an ``X'' may have to be modified as well.  Table~\ref{Table:trace} shows the
dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, and
instance models with each other. Table~\ref{Table:R_trace} shows the
dependencies of instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each
other. Table~\ref{Table:A_trace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, and likely changes on
the assumptions.

%The purpose of the traceability graphs is also to provide easy references on
%what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  The
%arrows in the graphs represent dependencies. The component at the tail of an
%arrow is depended on by the component at the head of that arrow. Therefore, if a
%component is changed, the components that it points to should also be
%changed. Figure~\ref{Fig_ATrace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
%general definitions, data definitions, instance models, likely changes, and
%assumptions on each other. Figure~\ref{Fig_RTrace} shows the dependencies of
%instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each other.

\section{Development Plan}
The development of the CT Image Reconstruction Tool will be carried out in a
structured manner to ensure accuracy, efficiency, and future extensibility.
Initially, the focus will be on implementing the core functionality, including
input validation, Radon Transform computation, and the application of log
transformation to convert intensity measurements into a linear attenuation
model. Once this foundation is established, the tool will integrate Fourier
filtering using both Ramp and Shepp-Logan filters, followed by back projection
to reconstruct the original image from the sinogram.\\

After the core functionality is implemented, the focus will shift to
enhancements and optimizations. This includes improving numerical stability,
optimizing computational efficiency, and refining filtering techniques.
Additionally, usability improvements, such as better error handling and
visualization tools, will be incorporated. Finally, an API extension will be
developed to allow the integration of new filtering methods, making the tool
scalable and adaptable for future research and applications.
