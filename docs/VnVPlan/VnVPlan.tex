This document outlines the VnV plan for FBP CT Image Reconstruction, ensuring compliance with
functional and non-functional requirements through systematic verification and
testing. It begins with General Information (Section~\ref{sec2}), covering objectives and
relevant documentation, followed by the VnV Plan (Section~\ref{sec3}), which details team
responsibilities, SRS and design verification, and automated testing tools.
System Tests (Section~\ref{sec4}) validate functional and non-functional requirements,
including input and output tests, with traceability ensuring full requirement
coverage. Lastly, Unit Test Description (Section~\ref{sec5}) defines the testing scope,
module-specific functional and non-functional tests, and the mapping of test
cases to system components.

\section{General Information} \label{sec2}

\subsection{Summary}
This document reviews the verification and validation plan for Filtered Back
Projection (FBP) CT Image Reconstruction. The FBP method is used to reconstruct
cross-sectional images from projection data collected in CT scans. The accuracy
and performance of the reconstruction process are evaluated based on predefined
validation criteria. The system’s usability, maintainability, and reliability
are also assessed using user inputs and experimental results.

\subsection{Objectives}
The purpose of the validation plan is to define how system validation will
perform at the end of the project.\st{The strategy will use to assess whether the
developed system accomplishes the design goals. Also, } The verification plan
includes test strategies, definitions of what will be tested, and a test matrix
with detailed mapping connecting the tests performed to the system
requirements.

Due to resource constraints, \add{verification}\st{validation} will be limited to
peer-based testing for accuracy and usability. While this ensures basic
functionality and user experience evaluation, the absence of domain experts,
such as doctors or researchers, prevents validation in real-world clinical or
research applications.

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}
The challenge level for this project is classified as general, requiring a
rigorous verification and validation process to ensure the accuracy and
performance of the system. The validation plan includes extensive functional and non-functional
testing, leveraging automated tools, formal proofs, and usability evaluations to
assess correctness, efficiency, and maintainability.

\st{Additionally, this project incorporates code walkthroughs, user documentation,
and design reviews to enhance system reliability and comprehensibility. The
scope of validation covers core algorithmic accuracy while excluding external
dependencies, which are assumed to be pre-validated. This structured approach
ensures that the system meets its defined performance, usability, and
verification requirements while adhering to resource constraints.
}

\add{The extra material will be a video, guiding user how to use this system.}

\end{center}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan} \label{3.2}
The SRS document for \progname will be verified using a structured review
process. The verification plan consists of the following steps:
\begin{description}
\item[Initial Review] \hfill \\
  Assigned reviewers, instructor (Dr. Smith) and domain expert
  (Xunzhou). will conduct a manual review of the SRS document. In this step, a
  structured
  \href{https://github.com/smiths/capTemplate/blob/9251702fdcb9800c59f6ed3d11d91e2bd62fca6d/docs/Checklists/SRS-Checklist.pdf}{SRS
    Checklist} will be used to systematically evaluate key aspects such as
  requirement completeness, consistency, feasibility, and traceability.
\item[Issue Tracking] \hfill \\
  \add{Reviewers}\st{eviewers} will provide feedback by documenting identified issues in an issue
  tracker (GitHub Issues). Each issue will be
  assigned to the document owner for later revision.
\item[Revision] \hfill \\
  The document owner will address reported issues by making necessary
  modifications to the SRS. Any unresolved or disputed concerns will be
  discussed among the reviewers.
\item[Final Documentation] \hfill \\
  After revisions, a final review will be conducted to confirm that all
  identified issues have been adequately addressed.
\end{description}


\subsection{Design Verification Plan} \label{3.3} The design documentation,
including the Module Guide (MG) and Module Interface Specification (MIS), will
be reviewed to ensure accuracy and completeness. The verification process will
involve a static analysis approach, where assigned reviewers will inspect the
documents to confirm that they align with system requirements and architectural
design principles. Reviewers will provide feedback through an issue-tracking
system, allowing the document owner to address concerns systematically. \\
A structured
\href{https://github.com/smiths/capTemplate/blob/9251702fdcb9800c59f6ed3d11d91e2bd62fca6d/docs/Checklists/MG-Checklist.pdf}{MG
  Checklist} and
\href{https://github.com/smiths/capTemplate/blob/9251702fdcb9800c59f6ed3d11d91e2bd62fca6d/docs/Checklists/MIS-Checklist.pdf}{MIS
  Checklist} will be used to ensure consistency, correctness, and traceability.
The finalized documents will be reviewed again to validate that all identified
issues have been resolved.

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan} \label{3.4} The
review process for Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan will involve assigned
team members in Table \ref{vnvteam} conducting a structured inspection to verify that the plan aligns
with project requirements and verification strategies.
Identified issues will be documented in an issue-tracking system for resolution.\\
A
\href{https://github.com/smiths/capTemplate/blob/9251702fdcb9800c59f6ed3d11d91e2bd62fca6d/docs/Checklists/VnV-Checklist.pdf}{VnV
  Checklist} will be used to assess key aspects of the plan, including coverage
of testing methodologies and traceability of requirements. The final review will
confirm that all necessary corrections have been implemented before approval.

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan} \label{3.5}

\begin{itemize}
\item Static Verification:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Code Walkthrough: A structured review process where team members [\ref{vnvteam}]
        manually inspect the code for correctness, maintainability, and
        adherence to design specifications. \add{This process will be held
          during the implementation presentation in the course.}\st{This process ensures that critical
        components meet functional requirements before execution.}
  \end{itemize}
  \item Dynamic Verification:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Unit Testing: All test cases outlined in Section~\ref{sec5} will
        be executed, covering both functional and non-functional requirements.
        These tests ensure correctness at the module and system levels,
        validating reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools} \label{3.6} To ensure the
correctness and efficiency of the \progname, the following automated
testing and verification tools will be utilized:
\begin{description}
\item[Unit Testing] \hfill \\
  \href{https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/}{pytest} will be used to test
  individual functions, such as backprojection and filtering operations, to
  verify that they produce the expected output given test input data.
\item[Performance Analysis] \hfill \\
  \href{https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#module-cprofile}{cProfill}
  will analyze execution time and identify performance bottlenecks in
  computationally intensive functions like fourier transforms and interpolation.
\item[Static Analysis] \hfill \\
  \href{https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/}{flake8} will enforce python code
  standards, ensuring maintainability and readability.
\item[Test Coverage] \hfill \\
  \href{https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.6.12/}{coverage.py} will measure
  test coverage to ensure that all critical functions are tested and validated
  against various datasets.
\item[Visualization] \hfill \\
  \href{https://matplotlib.org/}{matplotlib} will be used to visualize sinograms
  and reconstructed images, allowing for manual verification of reconstruction
  accuracy.
\end{description}
Continuous Integration (CI) tools will be Github Action. Tools for
\href{https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-pytest}{unit testing},
\href{https://github.com/marketplace/actions/flake8-action}{static analysis} can
run automatically.

\subsection{Software Validation Plan} \label{3.7} Currently, there are no
external datasets or domain experts available to validate the FBP CT Image
Reconstruction system. Since the system is not yet in real-world use and lacks
access to researcher for review, formal validation cannot be conducted at this
stage.

However, internal review sessions may be used to ensure that the system
aligns with \add{functional}\st{specified} requirements. Future validation efforts could include
structured user testing or a Rev 0 demo if external stakeholders become
available. Until then, verification efforts will focus on functional correctness
through testing, as outlined in the SRS verification section.


\section{System Tests} \label{sec4} This section outlines the testing framework
for verifying the system, covering both functional and non-functional
requirements. Section~\ref{TFR} details functional tests, including input tests
(\ref{output_test}) to validate data preprocessing and output tests
(\ref{input_test}) to assess reconstructed image accuracy. Section~\ref{TNFR}
focuses on non-functional testing, such as performance and usability
evaluations. Finally, Section~\ref{trace1} ensures traceability between test cases and
system requirements, maintaining comprehensive coverage and validation of the
system’s expected behavior.

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements} \label{TFR}
The functional requirements in \href{https://github.com/marischan888/Computed-Tomography-Image-Reconstruction/blob/main/docs/SRS/SRS.pdf}{SRS} are divided into input and output
tests. \\
R1 and R2 correspond to input-related tests, ensuring that the system
correctly processes input images, projection data, and transformations. The
tests for R1 and R2 are in the Section \ref{input_test} \\
R3 correspond to output-related tests, verifying the correctness of
Fourier filtering, back-projection, and reconstructed attenuation values. The
test for the R3 is in the Section \ref{output_test} \\

\section{Unit Test Description} \label{sec5}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}
All modules (reconstruction and simulation) will be covered

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\subsubsection{Reconstruction}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

Type: Automatic

Initial State: Pending input

Input: A dummy sinogram (2-D array) generated using Numpy with size 180
(projection angle) and a shepp (filter type as enum).

Output: True

Test Case Derivation: Comparing the dummy sinogram and the reconstructed result
and they should have the same shape.

How test will be performed: Use the dummy sinogram and 180 projection angle as
the reconstruction input. Then assert the shape of reconstructed image and dummy sinogram.

\item{test-id2\\}

Type: Automatic

Initial State: Pending input

Input: A dummy sinogram (2-D array) generated using Numpy with size 180
(projection angle) and a ramp (filter type as enum).

Output: True

Test Case Derivation: Comparing the dummy sinogram and the reconstructed result
and they should have the same shape.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}
In \progname projects, planning for nonfunctional tests of units will not be
that relevant. Because it is no need to consider the performance data and hard
to find researchers to do the test.

\newpage

\section{Appendix}

This is where you can place additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the test cases will call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.
